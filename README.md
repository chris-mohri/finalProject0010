# Abstract

In this project, we determine which neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the best. We decided to label the best neighborhood as the one that provides the most ideal cycling conditions—safety, enjoyability, and scenery—by analyzing several data sets provided by wprdc.org. To evaluate the final scoring for each neighborhood in each of the three metrics, we assumed that adding a normalized score of each metric would be a reliable weighting. From our findings, South Side Flats scored the best in the final scoring.
